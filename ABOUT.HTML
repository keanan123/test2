       <h5>Writer <span>& Speaker</span></h5>
           <p>My name is Karabo Sello and I am a  motivational writer,I have always had that love for writing.I started writing from such an early age and with the pressure
               from school I had that thrive of wanting to be the best when it came to essays,and because my English teacher at that time believed in me and 
               he challenged me to do more and he always motivated me to never stop writing.I have written many books and with every book i had a connection
               with every single one of them,I have sold over 100 million copies worldwide and more than thirty have appeared on national and international
               bestseller lists.Books have a way of healing and they are medicine to all the broken hearts out there,through reading we can better ourselves
               and unburden our sorrows.Books are amazing,they are funny and they make people laugh,they teach,they mould us into being better,I always had
               the courage to read and write and now I am a motivational speaker and a best writter  and without reading i would not have made 
               it into being someone I am today.</p>
